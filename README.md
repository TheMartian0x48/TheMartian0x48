## 👨‍💻 The Engineer in Me

I'm a Senior Software Engineer at **Arcesium** with 3+ years of experience shaping scalable, high-performance backend systems.
I enjoy turning chaotic puzzles into clean, reliable software and diving deep into architectures that need both speed and structure.

**What drives me:**
Microservices, system design, data lakes, and squeezing performance out of every layer.
**What inspires me:**
Mathematics and its uncanny ability to explain the universe. 🌌

## 🛠️ My Toolkit

**Languages:** Java, Python, Golang, C++, SQL, JavaScript, HTMX
**Core Stack:** SpringBoot, PostgreSQL, Apache Iceberg, DuckDB, MyBatis
**Cloud & Ops:** AWS (S3, SQS), Kubernetes, Docker, Airflow, Git

I love building systems that are fast, fault-tolerant, and quietly elegant under load.


## 🏍️ The Adventurer in Me

When the keyboard rests, the motorcycle rolls.
Solo rides are my way of resetting the world—no notifications, no noise, just the hum of the engine and the stories the road tells.

🏔️ **Mountains:** Himalayan routes that feel like stairways into the sky
🌊 **Coasts:** Long, quiet stretches where the sea becomes your soundtrack
🗺️ **Hidden Trails:** Offbeat villages, forgotten roads, and unexpected discoveries

“Code builds systems. Rides build perspective.”
